    <p>Our mystery shoppers provide assessments from the point of view of an industry specialist rather than of a typical customer. Our mode of operation removes the usual “eye service” factor of most employees to impress their boss by being more effective on the job when the boss is present. We come into your organization without notice to your members of staff but with the notice of the overall boss, especially when he/she is not around. We introduce ourselves as clients to your members of staff, especially those in customer service desk in order to properly assess their performance. Then we will write and compile our report which would be submitted to the management, indicating areas that need improvement in effectively managing your company’s customer services and give recommendations as applicable.</p>
