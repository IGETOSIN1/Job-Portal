                              For those who are registered with us, application for jobs can easily be done on our website via their profiles. <br/>
We employ different channels in adverting job vacancies we are filling e.g social media (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, WhatsApp Messenger). The instructions on how to apply for jobs is always listed in the job post but most times, applicants for job positions we advertise are asked to send their CVs to an email address. Our consultants go through all the applications sent in via email and pick suitable candidates who are then invited to be interviewed. <br/>
Kindly check our Contact page for all our social media accounts.
